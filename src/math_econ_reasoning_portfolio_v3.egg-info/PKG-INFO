# Math + Econ Reasoning Portfolio (NDA-safe excerpts)

This repository contains **carefully selected, NDA-safe excerpts** from a larger body of **math- and economics-based analytical work** used to design, evaluate, and verify **LLM reasoning and numerical reliability**.

The materials here focus on the **final verification layer** of much broader analyses:
- reduced-form problem statements  
- distilled numerical cores  
- deterministic validation logic  

The original tasks were typically **more complex, data-driven, and multi-stage**, but are presented here in **simplified, synthetic form** to remain fully public and NDA-compliant.

This is best viewed as a **portfolio of evaluation artefacts** rather than a full reproduction of the underlying research pipelines.

---

## What this repo demonstrates

- **Non-trivial numerical methods**  
  (bisection / root-finding, verification inequalities, Monte Carlo sanity checks)

- **Reproducible reference solutions**  
  with explicit tolerances and deterministic outputs

- **Answer validation & scoring logic**  
  similar to LLM evaluation / grading pipelines

- **Failure-mode awareness**  
  (bounds, monotonicity assumptions, bracketing errors, model misspecification)

- **Clean Python engineering**  
  (tests, CI, no side effects on import, CLI + JSON outputs)

---

## Important context (NDA-safe clarification)

The problems in this repository are **not full research problems** and **not client deliverables**.

They are:
- **condensed representations** of larger analytical tasks  
- using **synthetic or normalized parameters**  
- stripped of proprietary data, domain specifics, and contextual complexity  

In practice, the original tasks:
- involved richer stochastic structure or real datasets  
- required additional constraints, diagnostics, and robustness checks  
- were embedded in broader modeling or evaluation workflows  

What you see here corresponds to the **final reasoning and verification step** — the part most relevant for assessing **LLM numerical reasoning, correctness, and failure behavior**.

## Repository structure

- `problems/` — problem statements + failure modes  
- `src/econ_math_portfolio/models/` — model implementations (no code runs on import)  
- `validators/` — validators calling model code  
- `originals/` — original standalone scripts kept for transparency (not imported)  
- `rubrics/` — scoring rules inspired by LLM evaluation setups  
- `tests/` — pytest  
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI (Python 3.10–3.12)

---

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
python -m econ_math_portfolio list
```

## Development

Run linting and tests:
```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest
```

---

## CLI usage

```bash
python -m econ_math_portfolio reference credit_var_quantile
python -m econ_math_portfolio validate cpi_target_discount 0.26191
```

---

## Notebook demo

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/demo.ipynb
```

---

## JSON output (tool-calling friendly)

```bash
python -m econ_math_portfolio list --json
python -m econ_math_portfolio reference cpi_target_discount --json
python -m econ_math_portfolio validate cpi_target_discount 0.26191 --json
```

---

## Scoring rubric (LLM evaluation style)

```bash
python -m econ_math_portfolio score submissions/contract_good.json --json
```

Submission format:

```json
{
  "task_id": "cpi_target_discount",
  "answer": 0.26191,
  "explanation": "optional short explanation"
}
```

## How to interpret this portfolio

This repository is a **curated slice of real analytical work**, intentionally focused on:
- reasoning clarity  
- numerical correctness  
- verification and evaluation  

The goal is to show **how problems are checked**, not just how they are solved.
